    <h2>Part A: Task / Problem Definition</h2>
    <h3>1. Our problem</h3>
    <p>Our identified problem is the UI for Athena's course registration page. The UI is extremely busy, as there are 3 separate windows: searching for courses, seeing a summary of registration, and a calendar of the schedule. We define busy as being cluttered and overwhelming to the point where it causes the user to inefficiently register for classes.</p>
    <p>The first issue is that you cannot fully see each window. To see everything within a window, you need to either scroll within that window or expand it. This is problematic because when expanding a window, that window covers up other windows, which hides information from the user. This is an anti-affordance in which the user is losing the ability to view information/functionality from the blocked window.</p>
    <p>There are multiple issues regarding searching for classes using Athena's UI. First, the keyword search bar signifies that you can search by class name. 
The search bar can be considered an anti-affordance due to its unreliable nature when searching for a class using its name. Despite correctly entering the class name, there is no guarantee that the intended class will be located through this method. Also, if you want to search again for any reason, hitting the back button on the browser takes you out of the registration page. Second, the course number search bar requires specific syntax to find the correct class. Third, the advanced search option adds 16 more options to narrow your search, which adds more complication when finding classes.</p>
    <p>The cluttered UI of Athena presents a noteworthy issue that warrants attention. First, it is important to note that students are already stressed about course registration in general. Finding classes with the right times and days and building a schedule takes time. Not only that, students are competing with hundreds others to get the classes they want. This happens to be an issue that does not pertain to just UGA students, but also students at other universities. According to the Massachusetts Daily Collegian, a student-run newspaper at UMass, many students complain about not getting the classes they want because classes become full quickly or because of limited sections and classtimes. Mustang News, which reports news on Cal Poly University, labels registration as "the most stressful minutes of your life." Similar to UMass, many students at Cal Poly are struggling to get in classes they need, especially general education classes.</p>
    <p>The problem with having an overly complex UI is that it adds to the chaos that course registration already comes with. A super busy UI makes the registration process much more inefficient and time consuming. Not only will students be battling against hundreds of students who are competing for the same high-demand general education classes, but they will also be battling the challenges of navigating through a complicated UI. As a result, students feel frustrated and upset. The last thing students want is to not be able to find a course through the search function or be blocked by a window and lose crucial seconds to register for a class.</p>
    <p>Athena is an educational technology that is used by UGA students to register for classes, making this topic relevant to the project theme. A typical interaction with Athena's course registration page using the Seven Stages of Action includes the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Goal: A UGA student wants to register for a specific class.</li>
        <li>Plan: The student sees three options to search for the class: Subject, Course Number, and Keyword.</li>
        <li>Specify: The student knows the class name, therefore they decide to use the keyword search bar.</li>
        <li>Perform: The student types in the course name into the keyword search bar.</li>
        <li>Perceive: The student perceives that the search function did not return the course that the student was looking for.</li>
        <li>Interpret: The student thinks to themself that the search function does not work and is now confused and frustrated why the search function did not find the class they were looking for.</li>
        <li>Compare: The student's interpretation of what they perceive leads them to believe they have not met their goal to find the class they were looking to register for. The student decides to search for the same course using a different option.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This interaction is typical because when the user reaches the Athena course registration page, the first signifiers the user sees are 3 search bars in the register for classes window, the bars representing search by subject, course number, and keyword. Naturally, the user chooses 1 of the options to search based on what he or she knows about the course in mind. We also know this interaction is typical indirectly through the existence of websites such as Coursicle and Courseoff. According to Veronica Lewis in the article “Coursicle Class Scheduling App Review,” she writes that Coursicle makes searching for classes and the overall registration process much easier. Also, over 100 schools in the United States use Coursicle, which suggests that many prefer using Coursicle over their own registration systems to search for classes. Even in UGA's Red and Black, Liliana Amirhosseini, a student at UGA who studies biochemical engineering, prefers using Coursicle to build a schedule and “not go through Athena or anything else.”</p>
    <h3>2. Identify potential users</h3>
    <p>The user population most affected by the problem found within our study are University of Georgia students. Each semester, it is the responsibility of the students to register and search for classes using the Athena user interface.Professors are indirectly affected because if students have trouble finding the class they teach, it may result in smaller class sizes or even a cancellation of the course entirely. Also, advisors are indirectly affected because when students have trouble registering for classes, advisors are often contacted to help resolve the issues they are experiencing.</p>
    <P>Students would benefit from a solution because they will be able to register for courses much more efficiently, and students will feel like they have control over their schedules. Professors also benefit because students are able to register for their courses, which allows them to teach more classes and possibly earn more. Lastly, advisors benefit since they would need to resolve fewer student course registration conflicts.</P>
    <h2>Part B: Analysis of Existing Solutions</h2>
    <h3>1. Existing Solutions</h3>
    <p>According to Enlyft, existing services that relate to our problem of study are Ellucian Banner, Moodle, Blackboard, and Google Classroom. UGA's Athena is an example of the Ellucian Banner self-registration model. The stats from Enlyft show that Ellucian Banner is used the least by companies at only 1.13%, while Moodle was the most popular among the 4 at 27.85%. Numerous universities around the US use one of these tools or similar variants for students to register for courses.</p>
    <p>From what we gathered, other universities including Harvey Mudd College and North Carolina A&T experience similar issues in course registration, whether it be an overly complicated UI or an efficient method entirely. When looking at HMC's website about course registration, it shows there are 3 separate pages for searching for courses, results from the search, and a calendar layout of the classes. This makes it inconvenient for the student to navigate and switch between pages rather than seeing everything together. The search page has 10 different options the user needs to select, and many options including section status, course program, and course area are not all particularly useful. The result page fills the entire screen, and there is no way for the user to see how a particular class falls into his or her schedule without keeping track of the schedule separately or doing trial and error.</p>
    <p>The process looks entirely different at North Carolina A&T. Rather than an online method of registration, North Carolina A&T uses a system in which the student has to manually fill out a pdf form to register for courses. Therefore, students need to map out their course schedule by hand and sift through course catalogs to find the details of each course they are registering for. Not only is this process tedious, but it is much more time consuming than an online method of registration.</p>
    <p>Potential solutions to our problem are sites like Coursicle and Courseoff. Coursicle and Courseoff are websites that relate to our problem of study, and these websites have already attempted to solve our problem. They have addressed the issue of an overcomplicated and busy UI by making it simpler and more user friendly.</p>
    <p>The pros of Coursicle include having a fixed search bar, a very flexible search function (search by course name, course number, professor), and a minimalistic UI. Also, Coursicle notifies a user when a spot opens up for a particular class. The only con with Coursicle is that you cannot search by CRN.</p>
    <p>The pros of using Courseoff is that the calendar is displayed clearly and fully. There is also no need to expand windows, and each section on the page is scrollable. It is easy to select a subject and search for the desired course. The con of using Courseoff is that when adding courses to your schedule, the search bar gets pushed to the bottom and eventually off the screen. This makes the search feature not readily available for the user to conveniently search for other classes. If the user uses Courseoff for the first time, he or she may not know where to find the search bar and will be confused when trying to do so. You also cannot search by CRN.</p>
    <p>A major con with both Coursicle and Courseoff is that you cannot register for classes through either websites. These websites are often used to search for classes and plan out schedules, but they will not actually register a student for the courses they select.</p>
    <p>Despite the cons that Coursicle and Courseoff may have, they are popular among students to assist in searching and registering for courses. According to the Coursicle and Courseoff websites, Coursicle seems to be much more popular throughout the nation since Coursicle currently supports over 1000 schools, while Couseoff only lists 5. Both are applications that were designed to help students with searching for their courses and organizing their schedules without having to use their school's registration system.</p>
    <p>We believe that Coursicle in particular is so popular because it was created by individuals who were students themselves, and they are able to successfully address the issues that students face when registering for courses. The UGA’s Red and Black states that Joe Puccio, one of the cofounders of Coursicle, spent 7 hours to plan his schedule for the 5 classes he needed. That prompted him to address the inefficiency in course registration and build Coursicle. Another reason why Coursicle is so popular is because it combines the functionality of multiple systems into a single system, making it extremely convenient for users to use. The Red and Black article also mentions that Coursicle was able to combine the functionality of UGA Bulletin and Athena. UGA bulletin “informs students about courses and professors that may teach the course,” while Athena gives students the ability to “create their schedules and see what classes are available.”</p>
    <h3>2. Principles and Guidelines</h3>
    <p>Our potential solution products, like Coursicle and Courseoff, do well in unofficially conforming to many of the golden rules of design. Their designs are consistent, offer informative feedback, prevent errors, permit easy reversal of actions, and keep the users in control. Coursicle and Courseoff are consistent because their design and layout remains fixed, no matter how the user interacts with the system. For instance, the calendar view remains fixed while courses are being added, and the search field remains on the left side (Coursicle) or right side (Courseoff). Both systems also prevent errors by allowing the user to search with different attributes (name, number, professor), which gives the user flexibility rather than being limited to a specific format. They permit easy reversal of actions by providing ways to add or remove classes from the schedule easily. Lastly, both Coursicle and Courseoff keep users in control. Users are able to select the courses they want and build a schedule according to his or her preferences. All of these principles appropriately serve our users, and our goal is for our solution to also incorporate these same principles.</p>
