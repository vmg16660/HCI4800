    <h2>Part A: Task / Problem Definition</h2>
    <h3>1. Our problem</h3>
    <p>Our identified problem is the UI for Athena's course registration page. The UI is extremely busy, as there are 3 separate windows: searching for courses, seeing a summary of registration, and a calendar of the schedule. We define busy as being cluttered and overwhelming to the point where it causes the user to inefficiently register for classes.</p>
    <p>The first issue is that you cannot fully see each window. To see everything within a window, you need to either scroll within that window or expand it. This is problematic because when expanding a window, that window covers up other windows, which hides information from the user. This is an anti-affordance in which the user is losing the ability to view information/functionality from the blocked window.</p>
    <p>There are multiple issues regarding searching for classes using Athena's UI. First, the keyword search bar signifies that you can search by class name. 
The search bar can be considered an anti-affordance due to its unreliable nature when searching for a class using its name. Despite correctly entering the class name, there is no guarantee that the intended class will be located through this method. Also, if you want to search again for any reason, hitting the back button on the browser takes you out of the registration page. Second, the course number search bar requires specific syntax to find the correct class. Third, the advanced search option adds 16 more options to narrow your search, which adds more complication when finding classes.</p>
    <p>The cluttered UI of Athena presents a noteworthy issue that warrants attention. First, it is important to note that students are already stressed about course registration in general. Finding classes with the right times and days and building a schedule takes time. Not only that, students are competing with hundreds others to get the classes they want. This happens to be an issue that does not pertain to just UGA students, but also students at other universities. According to the Massachusetts Daily Collegian, a student-run newspaper at UMass, many students complain about not getting the classes they want because classes become full quickly or because of limited sections and classtimes. Mustang News, which reports news on Cal Poly University, labels registration as "the most stressful minutes of your life." Similar to UMass, many students at Cal Poly are struggling to get in classes they need, especially general education classes.</p>
    <p>The problem with having an overly complex UI is that it adds to the chaos that course registration already comes with. A super busy UI makes the registration process much more inefficient and time consuming. Not only will students be battling against hundreds of students who are competing for the same high-demand general education classes, but they will also be battling the challenges of navigating through a complicated UI. As a result, students feel frustrated and upset. The last thing students want is to not be able to find a course through the search function or be blocked by a window and lose crucial seconds to register for a class.</p>
    <p>Athena is an educational technology that is used by UGA students to register for classes, making this topic relevant to the project theme. A typical interaction with Athena's course registration page using the Seven Stages of Action includes the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Goal: A UGA student wants to register for a specific class.</li>
        <li>Plan: The student sees three options to search for the class: Subject, Course Number, and Keyword.</li>
        <li>Specify: The student knows the class name, therefore they decide to use the keyword search bar.</li>
        <li>Perform: The student types in the course name into the keyword search bar.</li>
        <li>Perceive: The student perceives that the search function did not return the course that the student was looking for.</li>
        <li>Interpret: The student thinks to themself that the search function does not work and is now confused and frustrated why the search function did not find the class they were looking for.</li>
        <li>Compare: The student's interpretation of what they perceive leads them to believe they have not met their goal to find the class they were looking to register for. The student decides to search for the same course using a different option.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This interaction is typical because when the user reaches the Athena course registration page, the first signifiers the user sees are 3 search bars in the register for classes window, the bars representing search by subject, course number, and keyword. Naturally, the user chooses 1 of the options to search based on what he or she knows about the course in mind. We also know this interaction is typical indirectly through the existence of websites such as Coursicle and Courseoff. According to Veronica Lewis in the article “Coursicle Class Scheduling App Review,” she writes that Coursicle makes searching for classes and the overall registration process much easier. Also, over 100 schools in the United States use Coursicle, which suggests that many prefer using Coursicle over their own registration systems to search for classes. Even in UGA's Red and Black, Liliana Amirhosseini, a student at UGA who studies biochemical engineering, prefers using Coursicle to build a schedule and “not go through Athena or anything else.”</p>
