    <h1>Synopsis:</h1>
    <p>Athena is UGA's student information system, and an important function that Athena provides is allowing students to register for courses. However, the issue with Athena’s course registration UI is that it appears cluttered to the point where users cannot efficiently register for classes. This is a problem worth addressing because course registration in itself is already a stressful process, especially since students are competing against each other to find classes that match their schedules. Having an overly busy UI makes the course registration process even more stressful, as it becomes more difficult to find classes and organize a schedule. Our goal is to build a system that allows students to register for classes more efficiently and intuitively than Athena’s current system.</p>
