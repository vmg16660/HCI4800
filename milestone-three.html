    <h3>2. Relevant User Stories and Why We Chose Them</h3>

    <h4>Searching</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>As a student, I want the search function to allow searching for a course by name, number, CRN, professor, and subject so that I can find a class based on the information I know about a course
            <ul>
                <li>It is important that the search function gives students multiple ways for finding their desired classes using the courses name, number, CRN, professor, and subject. It is vital that users are not boxed into having to know a specific attribute about a course. According to the principle of least effort, users want to do the least amount of work possible to get something done, in this case, to search for a class [2]. By allowing users to search using a variety of attributes, users can simply type what they know rather than having to find out a particular attribute for a class. This ultimately saves time for the user. There is a correlation between the time it takes for a student to register and how well they perform in school [8]. Having a multiple option search function may cut down student registration time and if so, students are more likely to have higher academic performance.</li>
