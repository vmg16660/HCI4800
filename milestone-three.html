    <h2>Part A: User Experience Requirement</h2>
    <h3>1. Creating and Organizing Our User Stories</h3>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Viewing</b>
            <ul>

    </ul>

    <h3>2. Relevant User Stories and Why We Chose Them</h3>

    <h4>Searching</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>As a student, I want the search function to allow searching for a course by name, number, CRN, professor, and subject so that I can find a class based on the information I know about a course.
        </b><ul>
                <li>It is important that the search function gives students multiple ways for finding their desired classes using the courses name, number, CRN, professor, and subject. It is vital that users are not boxed into having to know a specific attribute about a course. According to the principle of least effort, users want to do the least amount of work possible to get something done, in this case, to search for a class [2]. By allowing users to search using a variety of attributes, users can simply type what they know rather than having to find out a particular attribute for a class. This ultimately saves time for the user. There is a correlation between the time it takes for a student to register and how well they perform in school [8]. Having a multiple option search function may cut down student registration time and if so, students are more likely to have higher academic performance.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>As a student, I want the search to provide hints or display matching courses based on the keywords/numbers I type so that I can find the class I am looking for and adjust accordingly.
        </b><ul>
                <li>Having the search provide hints as the user types in a course is relevant because it makes it much easier for users to find courses he or she is looking for. Having hints or auto-suggestions guides the user in typing the correct search queries to avoid errors [1]. This is important through the golden rules of design, one of the principles stating that systems should prevent errors as much as possible. As previously stated, there is also a correlation between the time taken for students to register for classes and their overall academic performance [8]. Having the search function provide hints and auto suggestions speeds up registration time and therefore, may contribute to greater academic success.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Scheduling</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>As a student, I want to be able to add or remove classes from my schedule so that I can make any necessary adjustments and be in control of my schedule.
            </b><ul>
                <li>Giving students the ability to add and remove classes from an already set schedule is crucial because students sometimes mistakenly add the wrong class. Giving them the ability to fix that and also be able to add classes later gives them control over their schedule. This follows the golden rules of design principle of keeping users in control.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>As a student, I want to see if courses have schedule conflicts so that I can be aware of them and decide between which course to take.
            </b><ul>
                <li>This user story is important because a student should not be able to register for classes which have overlapping class times. We define schedule conflicts as two or more courses set for or overlap the same time slots of the schedule. According to the article “Information Visualization for Highlighting Conflicts in Educational Timetabling Problems” using visualizations to show conflicts within a schedule helps the student answer the crucial questions needed to resolve conflicts efficiently [9]. Questions like where the conflict occurs and what resources are involved in the conflict [9]. The easier these questions are answered, the faster the student can solve their conflict. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>As a student, I want to be able to withdraw from classes so that I can stop taking a course that I am already registered in.
            </b><ul>
                <li>This user story is relevant as it pertains to the UGA policy that students are allowed to drop/withdraw from a course at any time during the semester. The UGA policy states that “students who wish to withdraw from a course after the last day of the drop period for a term must withdraw through Athena [11].” Therefore, this function becomes a functional requirement of our application.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Registering</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>As a student, I want to be able to register for my classes so that I can be officially placed into the classes I put on my schedule.
            </b><ul>
                <li>It is crucial for students to be able to register for their classes because it is a requirement by many universities in order to be placed into a class. According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), registering for classes is an essential step in the enrollment process for students in higher education institutions [5]. Students need to complete this process before they can attend classes and receive academic credits towards their degree [5]. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>As a student, I want the register function to give me confirmation so that I can be sure that my classes have been successfully registered.
            </b><ul>
                <li>It is essential for students to receive confirmation of their course registration to ensure that they have successfully enrolled in the courses they have selected. According to a survey conducted by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), students highly value receiving confirmation of their course registration [10]. Receiving confirmation of course registration provides students with peace of mind and helps them avoid any potential errors or misunderstandings regarding their course schedule. In case of any issues with the registration process or course selection, students can quickly identify and address the issue with their institution.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Viewing</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>As a student, I want to be able to see the course location, time, and professor so that I know where and when the course will take place and who is teaching it.
            </b><ul>
                <li>It is important and relevant that students are able to see the course location, time, and professor for each course for several reasons. First, these attributes are significant factors that determine whether a student decides to add a course to his or her schedule. According to a survey conducted by Inside Higher Ed, a significant factor for students when selecting courses is the availability of the course at a convenient time and location [6]. A course’s time must match a student’s available space in the schedule, and the course must be located at a reasonable distance from the rest of the courses that are added. Students also want to choose courses that are taught by professors who have good ratings. Many students use websites such as Rate My Professor to determine whether or not to take a class [12]. By displaying the course location, time, and professors, users will be able to plan their schedule with clarity and know exactly what they are signing up for.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>As a student, I want the search bar and the schedule calendar to be easily accessible and visible so that I can search for courses quickly and visually see what my schedule looks like at all times.
            </b><ul>
                <li>Having a search bar and schedule calendar that is readily available for users to see is important and relevant to our solution because it provides the user with the ability to search for classes and view his or her schedule in the most efficient way possible. Although having the search bar or calendar hidden may allow more room for other features, it requires users to take an extra step of finding the search bar/calendar, which lowers usability and gives more work to the user [1]. Having the search bar and calendar visible at all times helps us achieve our goal of searching and viewing classes in a user-friendly and intuitive way.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>As a student, I want to see the number of seats available in a course so that I can know if a certain class has open spots.
            </b><ul>
                <li>It is relevant and important that users are able to see the number of seats available because users need to know whether a class is full or about to be full.	A significant factor on whether a student registers for a class is the availability of the class [6]. Having a feature to see the seat availables will allow students to know if there are spots left for a particular class and act accordingly.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>As a student, I want to see how many credits hours are on my schedule and how many credits hours I am registered for so that I can know if I need to add more classes to my schedule or register for more classes.
            </b><ul>
                <li>Having a student be able to see the number of credits on the schedule and the total number of credits registered is relevant because students need to know whether they meet certain credit thresholds. For UGA, students are required to have at least 12 credit hours to be considered a fulltime student [3]. Also, many scholarships such as Zell Miller and Hope may be affected based on the number of credit hours a student takes [4]. Therefore, it would be helpful for students to see how many credits are on the schedule and how many are registered so they can meet certain credit thresholds to maintain enrollment status and scholarships.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>As a student, I want to see the course name, course number, subject, and CRN of the searched courses so that I can identity a course and add it to my schedule.
            </b><ul>
                <li>Being able to see the course name, course number, subject, and CRN on courses that appear in the search result is relevant because students need to be able to get confirmation that the search results match with what they are actually searching. With our solution, the user is able to search using various attributes, some of which include the course name, number, subject, and CRN. Not displaying the attribute that the user searched with can be misleading, and the user may think that the wrong course came up. It is vital that search results are accurate because otherwise, the user does not trust the searching functionality [7].</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
